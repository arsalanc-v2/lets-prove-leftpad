## About Dafny

Dafny is an imperative language supporting specification constructs based on Hoare logic. This means specifications can be coupled together with their implementations and programs that pass the Dafny verifier are guaranteed to be correct. However, due to undecidability, Dafny may report errors for programs even though they may be correct on every runtime execution. This can be due to quantifiers, nonlinear arithmetic or missing annotations. As such, Dafny is incomplete.

## About the Proof

- explain decreases
- explain postconditions
- explain impl
- proof longer than the program
